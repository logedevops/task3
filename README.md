 I have deployed an application in guvi.com:9000, and logs show my app is running, but Iâ€™m unable to view the page. Check whether my port is open or not ?
         
         To check the port open "netstat" or "ss" command will be used 

Issue i faced 
  when i am using this command i have received an set of commands like 
  "Cannot open netlink socket: Protocol not supported"
